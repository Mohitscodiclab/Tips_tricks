## ⚠ **Important Notes**

🛑 The **IRM command in PowerShell** downloads a script from a specified URL, and the **IEX command executes it**.

🔍 **Always verify URLs before executing commands** to ensure security.

🚨 **Be cautious** ⚠, as some malware disguises itself as MAS using different URLs in the IRM command.

📌 To run the scripts in unattended mode, check **[here](#)**.
