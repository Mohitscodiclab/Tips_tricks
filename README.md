   ```
   bit.ly/blurwin

#### Installation Steps:

1. After the download is complete, open the downloaded folder.
2. Open the `RELEASE` folder.
3. You should find four unique files inside. **If not found, you have downloaded the WRONG file.**
4. Copy (`Ctrl + C`) all files.
5. Navigate to the `C:` drive.
6. Open the `Program Files` folder.
7. Paste (`Ctrl + V`) all copied files **(Allow all permissions if asked).**
8. Scroll to the bottom, and you will find the pasted files.
9. Run the `REGISTER` file **(Allow all permissions if asked).**
10. You will see the magic! Open any folder, and you will find a beautiful blur background.

> **Note:**
> - The `irm` command in PowerShell downloads a script from a specified URL, and the `iex` command executes it.
> - Always double-check the URL before executing the command and verify the source if manually downloading files.
> - Be cautious, as some spread malware disguised as MAS by using different URLs in the `irm` command.
