# 📡 Slow Scan Television (SSTV) in Space Communications

This project explores the use of **Slow Scan Television (SSTV)** in space, particularly by the **International Space Station (ISS)** and historical missions such as **Apollo 11**. SSTV is a technique for transmitting images over narrowband radio frequencies and has significant applications in amateur radio, space communication, and education.

---

## 🧠 Overview

- **SSTV** allows still image transmission using audio tones.
- It uses very little bandwidth (~3 kHz), ideal for space and amateur radio communications.
- Widely used in:
  - Historical space missions (Apollo, Luna, etc.)
  - Live ISS image broadcasts
  - Educational outreach programs
  - Amateur radio projects

## 🚀 Why SSTV is Used in Space

- ✅ **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Transmits over narrowband radio like voice communication.
- ✅ **Historical Use**: Enabled Moon images to be sent back to Earth (e.g., Apollo 11).
- ✅ **Educational Purpose**: Engages the public and students in space and radio science.
- ✅ **Amateur Radio**: Promotes global collaboration through events like ARISS (Amateur Radio on the ISS).

## 🛠️ How SSTV Works

1. **Image Encoding**: Images are converted into audio tones.
2. **Transmission**: These tones are sent using VHF radio (commonly 145.800 MHz).
3. **Reception**: Ground-based radios pick up the signals.
4. **Decoding**: Software like MMSSTV or QSSTV turns the audio back into images.

## 📡 How to Receive SSTV from the ISS

### 🧰 Required Equipment

- VHF radio or SDR (Software Defined Radio)
- Quarter-wave VHF antenna
- PC or smartphone
- SSTV decoding software (e.g., [MMSSTV](http://hamsoft.ca/pages/mmsstv.php), [QSSTV](https://github.com/qsstv/qsstv), or mobile SSTV apps)

### 📶 Steps

1. **Track the ISS** using satellite tracking apps (Heavens Above, ISS Tracker, etc.).
2. **Tune your radio** to 145.800 MHz (FM).
3. **Record the SSTV signal** during ISS pass.
4. **Decode the audio** using SSTV software to get the image.
