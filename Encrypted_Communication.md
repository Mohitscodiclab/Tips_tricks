## üöÄ Why Use Encrypted Communication?
Encryption is the foundation of secure digital communication. It ensures that only authorized parties can access transmitted data, protecting it from hackers, corporations, and surveillance.

### **Threats Without Encryption**
- **Government Surveillance:** Data collection by intelligence agencies.
- **Cyber Attacks:** Hackers stealing sensitive information.
- **Corporate Tracking:** Companies mining user data for advertising.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Interception of unsecured communication.

### **Encryption Benefits**
‚úî **Privacy**: Conversations remain confidential.  
‚úî **Security**: Prevent unauthorized data access.  
‚úî **Integrity**: Ensures messages are untampered.  
‚úî **Authentication**: Verifies sender identity, preventing impersonation.

## üîë Advanced Encryption Techniques

### **PGP Encryption for Emails**
- **GPG (GNU Privacy Guard):** Used for encrypting and signing emails.
- **Generate your key pair:** Use `gpg --gen-key`.
- **Encrypt a file:** Use `gpg -c file.txt`.
- **Decrypt a file:** Use `gpg -d file.txt.gpg`.

### **Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR)**
- **Used in XMPP chat protocols** for extra security.
- Ensures **perfect forward secrecy**, preventing old messages from being decrypted.

### **Zero-Knowledge Encryption**
- A method where **only the user holds the decryption keys**.
- Used by secure storage providers like **Tresorit** and **Proton Drive**.
