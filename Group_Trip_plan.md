3. **Kindling Crew**: Gather small twigs (armful per person)
4. **Fuel Team**: Collect larger wood (stack 3 ft high)
5. **Lighting Team**: Start fire while others maintain safety perimeter

#### Hunting Tools (Shared Resources)
- Spears (crafting team produces 2 per person)
- Bows and arrows (weapon team maintains group arsenal)
- Fishing lines and hooks (distributed to fishing teams)

#### Hunting Strategies (Team Tactics)
- **Driven Hunts**: Drivers push game toward hunters with spears
- **Tracking Teams**: 3-person units follow fresh tracks
- **Water Ambushes**: Groups stationed at watering holes at dawn/dusk

### Foraging for Food (Organized Collection)
- Berry patches (teams harvest only verified species)
- Nut groves (gathering crew collects 5+ lbs daily)
- Root/tuber excavation (digging team with tools)
- Heart of palm (harvesting team takes only 1/3 per tree)
- Bamboo shoots (collection team processes immediately)
