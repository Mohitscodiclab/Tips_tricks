# How to Become a Forensic Expert

## Overview

Forensic science is the application of scientific principles and techniques to criminal investigations. A forensic expert analyzes physical evidence to help law enforcement solve crimes. Specializations include forensic toxicology, pathology, ballistics, entomology, digital forensics, and more.

## Case Study: Differentiating Electrical Burns from Thermal Burns

### Title: "Detection of Copper in Electric Burns: Histological Evidence in Forensic Autopsies"

**Source**: Bellini et al., 2016 — Forensic Science International

### Summary:

* In 7 electrocution deaths, forensic experts found ambiguous burn marks.
* Histological staining and chemical analysis confirmed **copper deposition** in the tissue, proving electrical origin.
* Used **Timm’s Sulphide Silver Method** to detect copper.
* Ruled out thermal burns (which do not deposit metals like Cu, Ni).

### Method Used:

1. **Excised burn tissue** during autopsy
2. **Treated with ammonium sulfide**, then **silver nitrate + hydroquinone**
3. **Black deposits** in tissue confirmed copper metal = electrical burn

**Conclusion**: Chemical and histological analysis can differentiate electrical burns from thermal ones, crucial for determining cause of death in forensic investigations.
