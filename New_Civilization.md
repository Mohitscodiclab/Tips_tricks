   - Spindle: 20cm long, 2cm diameter, pointed ends  
   - Handhold: Stone with depression to hold spindle top  
   - Bow: 60cm branch with cordage (vine or twisted bark)  

2. **Setup:**  
   ```plaintext
   [Handhold]  
        ↑  
   [Spindle] → [Bow (wrapped around spindle)]  
        ↓  
   [Hearth Board] → [Tinder Bundle]
   ```  
   [IMAGE: Diagram showing bow drill setup with labeled components]  

3. **Technique:**
