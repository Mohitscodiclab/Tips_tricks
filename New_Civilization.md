- Hardwood stick (oak, maple) for spindle  
- Dry grass or bark for tinder  
- Sharp rock for carving  

**Alternative Fire Methods:**  
- **Sunlight Method (Sunny Climates):** Use curved lens-shaped ice or clear quartz to focus sunlight  
- **Flint & Steel (If Available):** Strike flint against steel to create sparks  
- **Chemical Method (Advanced):** Mix potassium permanganate (found in disinfectants) with glycerin  

**Step-by-Step Bow Drill Method:**  
1. **Carve Components:**  
   - Hearth board: Flat wood, 2cm thick, with 0.5cm deep hole  
   - Spindle: 20cm long, 2cm diameter, pointed ends  
   - Handhold: Stone with depression to hold spindle top  
   - Bow: 60cm branch with cordage (vine or twisted bark)  

2. **Setup:**  
   ```plaintext
   [Handhold]  
        ↑  
   [Spindle] → [Bow (wrapped around spindle)]  
        ↓  
   [Hearth Board] → [Tinder Bundle]
   ```  
   [IMAGE: Diagram showing bow drill setup with labeled components]  

3. **Technique:**
